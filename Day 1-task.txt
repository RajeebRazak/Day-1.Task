1 Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

                          HTTP1.1                                                        HTTP2
* Multiplexing:  HTTP/1.1: Uses a single request-response at a time,              HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be 
                  which means multiple requests require multiple connections.                  sent and received in parallel over a single connection.

* Header Compression: HTTP/1.1: Headers are not compressed, which can lead         HTTP/2: Headers are compressed, reducing the amount of data transmitte     
                      to increased overhead for each request                                and improving overall performance. 

* Binary Format:HTTP/1.1: Uses plain text for requests and responses.               HTTP/2: Employs a binary format, which is more efficient to parse and transmit.

* Server Push:HTTP/1.1: Does not support server push.                               HTTP/2: Allows servers to proactively send resources to the client before they are requested.

* Prioritization:HTTP/1.1: All requests are treated as equally important.           HTTP/2: Allows requests to be prioritized, ensuring critical resources are delivered first.

* Flow Control:HTTP/1.1: Lacks explicit flow control mechanisms.                    HTTP/2: Implements flow control at the frame level to prevent overwhelming the client.

* Server Efficiency:HTTP/1.1: Servers may be constrained by the number of           HTTP/2: Servers can more efficiently handle a larger number of requests due to multiplexing.
                       simultaneous connections they can handle.

* Domain Sharding and Concatenation:HTTP/1.1: Uses techniques like domain           HTTP/2: These techniques are discouraged and often unnecessary due to           
  sharding (splitting resources across multiple domains) and concatenation                  the improved multiplexing capabilities.          
   (combining multiple files into one) to improve performance

* Header Overhead: HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent with each request and response,       HTTP/2: Header fields are compressed, reducing the overhead associated with headers.
   which can lead to increased overhead.

* Connection Reuse:HTTP/1.1: Requires multiple connections for concurrent           HTTP/2: Allows for connection reuse, reducing the need to establish multiple connections.
                  requests, which can be less efficient

* Fallback Mechanisms:HTTP/1.1: Does not have built-in support for fallback         HTTP/2: Supports graceful fallback to HTTP/1.1 for clients that do not support HTTP/2
           mechanisms

* Round-Trip Optimization:HTTP/1.1: Requires multiple round-trips to establish      HTTP/2: Optimizes round-trips through techniques like header compression and multiplexing
                          connections and retrieve resources

* Server Load:HTTP/1.1: Can lead to increased server load due to the need for       HTTP/2: Reduces server load by allowing multiplexing and more efficient resource handling
                        multiple connections.

* Security:HTTP/1.1: No inherent security features, relies on additional            HTTP/2: Encourages the use of secure connections (HTTPS) and is designed with 
                      protocols like TLS for encryption.                                    modern security practices in mind

* Browser Support: HTTP/1.1: Universally supported by all browsers.                 HTTP/2: Widely supported by modern browsers, though support may vary for older browsers

2. Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?

  Understanding Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScriptJavaScript.

  JavaScript, as a versatile and widely-used programming language, relies heavily on objects. They are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript and form the backbone of most programs.
  In this blog post, we'll delve into what objects are, how they are represented internally, and why they are crucial in JavaScript programming.
 
 What are Objects in JavaScript?
 
 In JavaScript, an object is a composite data type that groups together related data and behavior. It's a collection of key-value pairs where the keys are strings (or Symbols) that act as 
  unique identifiers for the values. These values can be of any data type, including other objects, functions, arrays, and primitive types like strings, numbers, and booleans.Objects in 
  JavaScript are used to represent real-world entities, abstract concepts, and more. For example, a user object might have properties like name, email, and age, along with methods functions
  interacting with that user.

 Internal Representation of Objects

  Under the hood, JavaScript engines implement objects using a combination of memory management techniques and data structures. Let's explore the key aspects of how objects are internally
  represented:

 1. Property Descriptors:

 Each property of an object has an associated property descriptor that defines the behavior of that property, including attributes like writable, enumerable, and configurable.

 2. Hidden Classes:

 JavaScript engines employ a technique called "hidden classes" or "shapes" to optimize property access. When an object is created, it is associated with a hidden class that defines the
  layout of the object in memory.

 3. Property Maps:

 Objects with the same hidden class share a property map, which is a data structure that keeps track of property names and their corresponding offsets in memory.

 4. Proto Chain:

 Objects in JavaScript are linked together through a prototype chain. Each object has a __proto__ property that points to its prototype object. This allows for property delegation 
  - if a property is not found on an object.JavaScript looks for it in its prototype and continues up the chain until it reaches null.

 5. Garbage Collection:

 JavaScript engines use garbage collection algorithms to reclaim memory that is no longer in use. This ensures that objects are automatically cleaned up when they are no longer referenced.

 Why Objects are Crucial.

  Understanding how objects are represented internally is crucial for writing efficient JavaScript code. Here are a few reasons why objects are essential:

 1. Organizing Data:

   Objects allow us to organize related data and behavior in a structured manner, making our code more readable and maintainable.

 2. Code Reusability:

   Objects facilitate code reuse through concepts like inheritance and composition, enabling us to build on existing functionality.

 3. Complex Data Modeling:

  Objects are invaluable for modeling complex real-world entities and relationships, providing a powerful abstraction mechanism.

 4. Efficient Property Access:

  Understanding hidden classes and property maps helps optimize property access, leading to faster execution times.

 5. Prototype-based Inheritance:

  The prototype chain allows for a flexible and powerful form of inheritance, enabling the creation of hierarchies of objects.
